#Introduction to the Repository

This macro-level tool provides analysis of the tax system, tax structure, trends, buoyancy, tax gap, regional comparisons, and more. In this repository, you will find the following files:

1. The Stata version of the tool (Tax Country Analysis - Gov Rev Database.do), which offers a high level of control to the user, and the greatest detail on how analysis is conducted.  
2. The Excel version of the tool (Tax Revenue Analysis Tool (User Interface).xlsx), which hides the technical process and offers a user-friendly presentation of the analysis.  
3. Raw data files used in the analysis, and a compiling do-file that builds the database (Prepare Government Revenue Dataset.do).  
4. A Powerpoint slideshow introducing the tool.
